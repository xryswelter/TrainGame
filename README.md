### Purpose of Web App

This webpage was created to demonstrate my skill with API keys using Firebase as a database to create a simulation of a train schedule.  In addition, it demonstrates my ability to use methods and such to create new variables based on user input to create outcomes that are desired.

### How to Use App

To use the application please do the following:
1. Please enter in your train's name, destination, start time and the frequency it comes to your station into the form at the bottom.  
2. Your train will information will then be added to the table at the bottom upon submission.  Train information will now update upon page refresh with the next train arrival as well as how long till it arrives in minutes.

AN: please note that this is a simulation of a train schedule and should not be used as a reference unless you enter in accurate information about your train.
